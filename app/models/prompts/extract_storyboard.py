    **CRITICAL: All generated visual and appearance descriptions will be directly used for AI image generation. Every visual detail you provide will be processed by AI image generation systems to create actual images.**
    
    **UNIVERSAL DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS:**
    - **PRECISION AND CONCISENESS**: All descriptions MUST be precise, concise, and accurate
    - **NO REDUNDANCY OR VAGUENESS**: Eliminate repetitive, redundant, ambiguous, or unclear language
    - **OPTIMAL LENGTH**: Keep descriptions comprehensive yet concise - include all necessary details without unnecessary elaboration
    - **SPECIFIC TERMINOLOGY**: Use exact, specific terms and direct language that immediately conveys visual information
    - **FOCUSED CONTENT**: Every word must serve a clear purpose - remove filler words, unnecessary adjectives, or redundant phrases
    - **AVOID REPETITION**: Never repeat the same information within a single description or across related descriptions
    - **ESSENTIAL DETAILS ONLY**: Include only details that are essential for accurate visual representation
    - **CONTENT SAFETY**: Avoid any descriptions that could be considered inappropriate, suggestive, or adult-oriented to prevent AI image generation rejection
    - **NO ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTIONS**: Avoid using "or", "either...or", "A or B" patterns. Choose ONE specific option and describe it definitively
    - **CRITICAL**: NEVER use uncertainty words like "either", "or", "possibly", "maybe" in any descriptions
    
    **STYLE ANALYSIS AND ADAPTATION:**
    Before generating descriptions, analyze the provided visual style:
    - If the style indicates grayscale/monochrome characteristics (pencil, sketch, charcoal, ink, ukiyo-e, watercolor, etc.):
      * COMPLETELY IGNORE any color information from the original script
      * Establish a CONSISTENT TONAL HIERARCHY for each character across all shots
      * Use STANDARDIZED TONAL DESCRIPTORS: "Pure light tone", "Bright tone", "Medium-light tone", "Balanced tone", "Medium-dark tone", "Deep tone", "Pure dark tone"
      * TEXTURE-BASED DIFFERENTIATION instead of color variation
      * CHARACTER TONAL CONSISTENCY PROTOCOL: Assign each character a unique tonal signature that remains constant
      * ENVIRONMENTAL TONAL CONSISTENCY PROTOCOL: Establish a master environmental tonal palette for the entire storyboard
    - If the style indicates full color characteristics, include appropriate color descriptions from the script
    - Adapt all visual terminology to match the specific artistic medium and techniques implied by the style

          * IMPORTANT: The "dialogues" field is MANDATORY and must always be included
          * CRITICAL: For voiceover/narration, the role_name MUST be exactly "voiceover"
          * CRITICAL: Only parse dialogue from characters that appear in the current shot's selected_roles array
          * CRITICAL: Dialogue characters MUST be present in the shot - no off-screen dialogue except voiceover
      
        - **Technical Parameters with Integer Values**:
          * **Shot Size**: Long Shot (0), Full Shot (1), Medium Shot (2), Close Shot (3), Close-Up (4)
            - Long Shot: Displays a vast environment and conveys the smallness of characters, emphasizing the atmosphere or spatial relationships of the scene.
            - Full Shot: Fully captures a character's entire body and surrounding environment, establishing the foundation for actions and spatial positioning in the narrative.
            - Medium Shot: Frames a character from the knees up, balancing action details and body language to advance dialogue or interactions.
            - Close Shot: Focuses on a character's chest and above, highlighting facial expressions or subtle reactions to intensify emotional or psychological tension.
            - Close-Up: Zooms in on specific parts (e.g., eyes, hands), vividly portraying critical details to create visual impact or metaphorical significance.
          * **Camera Angle**: Eye-level (0), Low-angle (1), High-angle (2), Bird's-eye (3), Dutch-angle (4)
            - Eye-level: Shot at eye level, creating a natural and realistic feel, placing the audience on equal footing with the characters.
            - Low-angle: Shot from below looking up, enhancing the character's dominance, authority, or the grandeur of the environment.
            - High-angle: Shot from above looking down, diminishing the character's power, conveying vulnerability, isolation, or control.
            - Bird's-eye: Vertical overhead shot of the entire scene, showcasing the full scope or a sense of character insignificance and fate.
            - Dutch-angle: Deliberately tilted frame, creating imbalance, tension, or psychological distortion for dramatic effect.
          * **Camera Movement**: Fixed Shot (0), Push Shot (1), Pull Shot (2), Pan Shot (3), Tracking Shot (4), Tilt Shot (5), Zoom Shot (6)
            - Fixed Shot: Fixed camera, expressing calmness, observation, or compositional tension.
            - Push Shot: Camera moves forward, emphasizing focus, closeness, or heightened emotions.
            - Pull Shot: Camera pulls back, conveying distance, spatial revelation, or reversal.
            - Pan Shot: Camera rotates horizontally, showcasing space, guiding perspective, or transitioning.
            - Tracking Shot: Camera follows the subject, creating immersion, rhythm, or character tracking.
            - Tilt Shot: Camera tilts vertically up or down, conveying oppression, grandeur/smallness, or revealing height.
            - Zoom Shot: Camera zooms in or out without moving, emphasizing focus/distance, psychological impact, or perspective compression.
          * **Duration**: 1-8 seconds based on narrative needs
            - Very short shot (1 second): Creates tension, fast pace, or chaotic scenes (e.g., action sequences, horror flickers).
            - Short shot (2â€“3 seconds): Maintains narrative flow, suitable for dialogue transitions or quick information delivery.
            - Medium shot (4â€“6 seconds): Balances rhythm, allowing the audience to process information or observe character performance.
            - Long shot (6+ seconds): Builds tense atmosphere, dramatic effect, or transitions.
          
    **STRICT SPATIAL CONSISTENCY:**
    - Depth, orientation, and camera must be physically coherent:
        * Character relationships across layers must reflect plausible facing and visibility. Example: if a foreground character is oriented toward a midground character, the foreground character must present their back or side to the camera so their gaze is toward the midground figure; they cannot face the camera directly while visually looking at a midground character (no spatial paradox).
        * If two characters are facing each other across depth (foreground vs midground), their relative sizes, occlusion, and perspective must reflect distance: the foreground character appears larger and may partially obscure the midground, and their eye lines must converge logically.
        * Camera-facing orientation must align with interaction: a character looking at another must have body/face turned toward that target; if the camera lies between them and would block that view, the description must specify that the character is shown from behind, profile, or appropriate angle to preserve line-of-sight consistency.
        * No contradictory placements such as a background character appearing larger than a foreground character, or characters appearing to simultaneously face opposite directions in a way that breaks spatial depth.
        * Depth reporting must include relative scale cues consistent with the designated layer (foreground > midground > background in visual prominence unless intentional framing is described with justification).
    - All spatial relationships must be unambiguous and logically coherent.
          
    **IMAGE GENERATION OPTIMIZATION:**
      - **Character Description**: Optimized for 576x1024 portrait aspect ratio, emphasizing the importance of full-body descriptions
      - **Scene Description**: Adjust composition descriptions based on project aspect ratio {aspect_ratio}
      - **Style Consistency**: Ensure all descriptions remain consistent with the provided visual style
      
    **COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**    
       - **LANGUAGE DETECTION AND VALIDATION**:
        * **Detect and identify the primary language of the userâ€™s input script**
        * **Verify that the detected language matches the expected language parameter**
        * **Ensure that all subsequent content generation strictly uses the userâ€™s input language**
      - **CHARACTER VALIDATION**:
